        <h1>Review - Moto Guzzi Stelvio NTX 1200</h1>

    <br>
    <p>“Who makes those?” and “Do they still make these?” Now as we all know motorcycles attract a lot of attention but in the case our Stelvio NTX these two comments are most often heard from passersby’s and admirer's alike.</p>
    <p>It's just part of owning and riding any Moto Guzzi Motorcyle - - new or old alike.</p>
    <p>Who can fault people because even today a Moto Guzzi is a rare sight on our roads and having ridden this 2013 Moto Guzzi Stelvio 1200 for the past week I have grown accustomed to participating in a somewhat, dare I say  ‘exotic’ and 'exclusive' rare bike club.</p>
    <br>
    <h4>So what is like spending time Moto Guzzi’s ADV offering?</h4>

            <figcaption>The face only a mother could love.</figcaption>
        </div>
        <p>As most Guzziphiles will tell you, “Moto Guzzi has been going out of business since 1921”. The basis of all their motorcycles is a tried and true design that has fundamentally changed little over the years.</p>
        <p>In the case of the Stelvio NTX, Guzzi built an ADV Motorcycle around an already well established 1200 cc, 4-valve, air cooled V-twin mounted transversely in the chassis.</p>
        <p>This engine can trace it’s roots back just over 50 years to the original 1967 V-700 which introduced this engine design to the world. The engine is shared with two other Guzzi offerings, the Griso (standard/naked) and Norge (sport touring).</p>
        <p>Collectively these motorcycles are know as the CARC bikes (Cardano Reattivo Compatto - Compact Reactive Shaft Drive) in reference to Moto Guzzi's own 'Anti Shaft Jacking' swingarm design. Moto Guzzi has produced roughly 10,000 Stelvios in a span of 10 years (2008-2016).</p>

                <figcaption>That "Quattro Valvole" Engine!</figcaption>
        </div>
        <p>Currently Moto Guzzi is part of a larger parent company, namely the Piaggio Group (most famous for the Vespa brand of motor scooters) which thankfully also includes Aprilia. It would seem that the 1200 has seen some serious R & D time with Aprilia’s own engineers.</p>
        <p>This marriage of Aprilia tech and Guzzi tradition translates into an engine that does a good job of mixing old with new technology. Pushrods have given way to a chain driven, overhead cam design with 4 valves per cylinder blessed with a very modern narrow valve angle cylinder head design.</p>
        <p>All this translates to an old design but with a refreshing modern character that rewards the rider with 105 hp and 85 pound feet of torque.</p>
        <p>Not current 'superbike' standards but the Stelvio NTX rewards the rider with a rush of speed that begins at 4,000 RPM and pulls up to it's 8,500 Redline.</p>

                <figcaption>and a comfy seat!</figcaption>
        </div>
        <p>How does this translate in daily riding? As many big bore ADV bikes (like BMW’s ubiquitous GS series) have proven, these motorcycles are well suited to on road touring and for many owners, this is what they do.</p>
        <p>The Stelvio is no exception.</p>
        <p>The large V-twin easily provides enough grunt for both rider, passenger and full load of luggage.</p>
        <p>Our Stelvio came with side panniers and an optional top box (by SW-Motech) which in total provides 132 liters of storage capacity - nice.</p>
        <p>Couple that with one of the largest gas tanks on any stock production motorcycle at 32 liters and your looking at a good 400+ KM range before it’s time to fill up.</p>
        <p>Our Stelvio came equipped with an extra comfy Corbin seat but stock seat design is also very comfortable.</p>
        <p>Only criticism is the seat height, stock or after market, despite having both a high and low setting, it will prove tricky for riders even the "not so short in the inseam".</p>

        </div>
        <p>Loaded with fuel the Stelvio will easily top 650 pounds, which coupled with the above mentioned seat height makes for a tricky ride especially at slow speed and parking lot maneuvers.</p>
        <p>However for anyone that would like a unique ride, dare I say something so unique it may be considered exotic, heirloom marque and a very competent and easy to maintain ADV, one should not pass up on the Stelvio.</p>
