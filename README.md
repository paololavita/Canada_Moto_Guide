CMG - Canada Moto Guide

Technology Used: HTML and CSS

This is a prototype HTML webpage I coded using HTML and CSS.

The contents were a motorcycle review for a local motorcycle website called CMG Online.

I took and edited the photos as well as authored the review.

Gave me a chance to begin to use codeing skills.
